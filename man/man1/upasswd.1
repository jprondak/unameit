.TH UPASSWD 1
.SH NAME
upasswd - password changing program when running UName*It
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upasswd
[
.I login
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is the password changing command you should use when
running UName*It. This program talks to both the
.IR yppasswdd (1m)
daemon and 
.IR unameitd (1m)
to change the password. The regular
.IR yppasswd (1)
command only talks to the
.IR yppasswdd (1m)
daemon so it cannot be used to change your password in UName*It.
.SH SEE ALSO
unameitd(1m), yppasswdd(1m)
