		Changes from version 2.5.2 to version 2.5.3

CONFIGURATION:
    The user and host <mode>.conf files are now:

	${HOME}/.unameit/${UNAMEIT_MODE}.conf

    and

	/etc/unameit/${UNAMEIT_MODE}.conf

    respectively.  Previously they were one level deeper in a "config"
    subdirectory.  You will want to move, copy or link the config files
    to their new locations.

SCHEMA:
    Allow hyphens and undescores in Principal names.  This makes it possible
    to add host_principal objects for services such as "unameit-<mode>"
    (used by UName*It servers and root clients).

    Restrict host_principal owner to be in same organization as host.  The
    previous same cell restriction was too tight.

    Please run "$UNAMEIT/boot/upgrade" to upgrade your schema.

CLIENTS:
    More detailed "Preview" window in "unameit".

    Graphical client "unameit" and "unameitcl" transmit transaction summary
    (as in "Preview" window of "unameit") for logging on server.

    Constraints which use the "contains" operator on set/sequence
    pointer attributes now match objects that point to *at least all of*
    of the specified items, rather than the previous *at least one of*
    of the specified items.  (Note: "contains" is the implicit operator
    for UI set/sequence queries).

UI:
    Creation of new windows was failing.

    Display "traverse" as a pull right menu if and only if
    the field is empty and the pointer domain has subclasses.

    Modal dialogues did not always steal the keyboard focus.

    Fixed possible core dump in TOI ("unameit") client due to object
    sorting function being non monotone in some situations.

    Fixed Tk bug with background colour names containing white space.

UNAMEIT SERVER:
    New configuration option "enable_logging" controls whether server
    actually logs the transaction.

    The "comment" field can now have "inherited" attribute records,
    allowing custom labels or syntax in subclasses.

PULL SERVER:
    Fixed bug when pull server is started before first backend
    run or first slave server pull.

LICENSE:
    UName*It server license information is now located in /etc/unameit/license
    on the server host. This is the same format as the information previously
    in the configuration file. It may be copied verbatim from an e-mailed 
    license, as only the items beginning with 'license_' are used.

UNAMEIT SERVER and PULL SERVER:

    Fixed race condition in returning "short" results to clients.
    Problem would occasionally result in broken connection with a loaded
    server, (most likely during pull authentication).

UPGRADE:
    Fixed bug in conversion from release 2.2.2 for user_login records
    with mail forwarding to multiple external addresses.

BACKEND:
    Updated internet root name server list for sites with no internal
    root DNS name server.

UPASSWD:
    Added "uchsh" link for "upasswd"

    Fixed bug where NIS shell was set to (e.g.) "csh" instead of
    /bin/csh when changing the password.

LOADUP:
    Added a script to load host data from a DNS server. The domain given
    in the input file setup is used as the domain to load. The DNS server
    is contacted directly to get the information to load.

		Changes from version 2.5 to version 2.5.2

LICENSE:
    2.5.1 Uses UName*It license keys that are not compatible with
    previous releases.  Please contact us for a new license key.
    The UniSQL/X license keys from previous release continue to work.

CONFIGURATION:

    By popular request DNS is no longer required (or explicitly used)
    by UName*It.  This means that we cannot automatically and reliably
    determine the fully qualified names of servers and clients,
    and hence cannot contruct V5 service principals just from the service
    and host names.
    
    The solution taken was to explicitly configure the instance and realm
    of each server and client.  "unameit_mode create" and "upull_mode create"
    will now query for additional parameters:

	"Local FQDN"	is the fully qualified name of the current host,
			used to build kerberos instances of servers
			and "root" clients running on this host.

	"Server FQDN"   is the fully qualified name used to build the
			kerberos instance of the UName*It server,
			must equal to the "Local FQDN" configured on
			the server.

	"Upull Server FQDN"
			is the fully qualified name of the "upstream"
			Pull server used by this host,  must equal to the
			"Local FQDN" configured on that server.

			NOTE:  One can no longer specify a list of
			pull servers in "Upull Server",  since we cannot
			determine the kerberos instance and realm dynamically.

    The kerberos realm is by default initialized to the empty string,
    which translates to the default realm of current host.

    In a multi realm environment, for all servers outside the "local" realm,
    the server realm must be configured explicitly
    (by editing the configuration file).

BACKEND:

    Fixed bug in "pull_main.tcl" when netgroups need to be split due
    to NIS DBM limitations.

    Fixed bug where "uparsedb" was not deleting old data and gen
    directories.

    Mail address cache in tcldump was broken.  Fixed.  Impact should
    be slightly better performance (previously always missed cache).

    Added user_login automounts to automount file for region of user.
    (To preclude it from being obscured by intermediate domain in cell).

    Don't bother to forward person mail to accounts which in turn
    forward to /dev/null

    Various performance fixes.

DATA CACHE FUNCTIONS:
    Compare elements of distinct classes if they have same name attributes.
    Previously was just comparing the class names.  Results in improved
    sorting when elements multiple classes are displayed together.

    "unameit_sort_uuids" may not be able to the hardwired elements
    of internal meta-schema classes.  These are only needed by the
    server to validate schema changes,  and are not accessible via the
    GUI.  Should not be a problem.

SCHEMA BROWSING FUNCTIONS:
    Fixed "unameit_get_attribute_type" to return just the type without
    multiplicity.  Renamed to "unameit_attribute_type" just avoid any
    undetected problems with the change in semantics.

    Added "unameit_is_pointer" for use in all those places where we
    we switched on the parsed result of "unameit_get_attribute_type".

UPGRADE:
    New integrated upgrade "shell" script.  Takes care of migrating schema
    and data from all 2.x releases in use at customer sites.

SCHEMA:
    Bumped schema major number to 5.0.1
    Relaxed overly restrictive syntax for external mail addresses.

SCI:
    No longer need scierror,  now rely on unameitcl for error decoding.

    Use new "unameit_attribute_type" function as necessary.

    Use "unameit_is_pointer" where desirable.

UNAMEIT_LOAD:
    (Updated from 2.2.2,  not shipped with 2.5).

    Use new config files for server name, port etc.

    No longer duplicate data in ".dat" files if "Generate Load Script"
    is run multiple times on the same cache.

    Added support for loadup of /etc/services

    Can now load aliases file into new mail schema.

    Now match "First Last, junk" in gecos with "Last, First" in
    "persons" file or database.

    Fixed load of automounts.

    Take care not to clobber server's data directory when load
    is run in the wrong directory.

    Rexec as "wishx" for gui command,  all other commands use "tcl"

    "load_adaptive" no longer finds the script to load from the
    environment.  The server now can now pass additional arguments
    to "boot" scripts:  e.g. unameitd <script> <arg1> ...

    Improved netmask processing for hosts and networks

    Application login load does not use/need automount information.

    Group members are *not* constrained to be only
    user_logins or only application_logins (according to group class).

    Improved and re-arranged GUI buttons.

    Autogenerate networks for additional interfaces of multi-homed
    hosts.

UDUMPDB:
    Return success if server appears to be already down.

UNAMEIT:
    Put mode name on all toplevels except error dialogues.

    Use config options to set "queryMaxRows" and "queryTimeOut".
    (Default to 256 and 10 resp. if missing).

    Old client will exit running against new server.  Old cache
    manager interface not compatible with downloaded code.

UNAMEITCL:
    Scripts can arrange to print stack traces on error exit
    by unsetting the global array element TCLXENV(noDump).

UNAMEITD:
    Errors in authentication module initialization now detected before
    the server detaches from the controlling terminal.

    Now server rereads the toi.tcl file whenever the mtime changes.

    Fixed bug in percentile code in about box.

UPULL:
    Upulld no longer typically a large number of mmapped files.
    (Now at most one per connected client).

		Changes from version 2.2.2 to version 2.5

- Kerberos 5 is now used for authentication instead of Kerberos 4.

- The installation and configuration has changed. There can now be more than
  one UName*It server running, each in a different "mode". You specify which
  server you want to connect to by setting the UNAMEIT_MODE environment
  variable.

- The mailing list schema has been changed. You can now mail to external
  mail delivery agents such as HP OpenMail. Persons now have mail handles
  and you can send mail to a person's mail handle. All the person's mail
  can go to the mail handle machine, to a user login associated with a person
  or mail can go separately to the mail handle machine and the user login
  depending on whether you send mail to the mail handle or the user login name.
	The mailing list schema has been simplified also. File drops, program
  drops and external addresses are now separate objects. The ramification of
  this is that if you update one of these objects, it is updated on all the
  mailing lists containing it. This did not used to be the case.
	Mailing lists are now pre-expanded rather than sent to a knowledgeable
  mailhost that knows how to expand the mailing list. This limits the global
  dependency between machines and allows UName*It to be more easily installed
  in an environment not currently running UName*It. Also, each aliases file
  now gets all the mailing lists in the database (most end up in NIS).

- Netgroups have been simplified. There are no longer automatic netgroups
  so pull processing is much quicker. Also, you can specify a region or cell
  as the right hand side of a netgroup and all the hosts or users in that
  region will be included in that netgroup. This facility takes the place
  of the automatic netgroups which were removed.
	Also, subnetgroups are now added in the Host Netgroup Member or
  User Netgroup Member form. They used to be added in the Host Netgroup or
  User Netgroup form. This was an inconsistency. Also, all netgroups are
  output to the netgroup file now, some with fully qualified names.

		Changes from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.2

- Fixed bug in checking attribute domain during schema validation.

- Fixed a couple of bugs in obscure error messages in the server.

- The "Connection to server is broken" error message now longer asks
  you if you want to send a bug report.

- Text and text list boxes now have popups that you can edit with the
  edit button.

- Fixed a bug in queries that caused a core dump when doing nested queries.
  This bug could only be tickled by using unameitcl.

			Changes from version 2.2 to 2.2.1

- Regional pull server pull over all the pull files. They now generate
  Unix files for their machine from the local data rather than repulling
  the data from the remote pull server.

- Duplicate fields are now detected in the "displayed attribute" list
  in the UName*It Data Class form.

- The region and host form now has field to create a wildcard MX record
  for the region.

- Speeded up pull netgroup and group generation.

- Added unameit_deletedb command for deleting the database and added
  manual page for unameit_makedb.

- Added Forward button in addition to Back button.

			Changes from version 2.1 to version 2.2

- The load up scripts now load Persons in a separate step rather than
  loading them with User Logins.

- Fixed a bug in loading User Groups where User Groups were being
  checked for a collisions at the organization rather than cell level.

- The structure of the lib directory has been broken down into several
  subdirectories to avoid putting unrelated files in the same
  directory.
