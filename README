UName*It is a name space management system for Unix and Windows
machines. It generates name space data for all the machines within an
organization. It was developed by Enterprise Systems Management Corp.,
which ultimately stopped selling the system, leaving it orphaned.

The sources to UName*It were then released under the GPL by 
Enterprise Systems Management Corp., and are now being maintained by
Viktor Dukhovni (the original lead programmer and architect) and
Perry Metzger.

Currently, the software does not yet build and run -- most
importantly, the code needs to be ported from UniSQL/X to an open
source database management system.
