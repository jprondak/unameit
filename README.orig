UName*It is a name space management system for Unix and Windows
machines. It generates name space data for all the machines within an
organization. UName*It also comes with the Internet Software Consortium
DHCP server and it manages the data used by this DHCP server. 
	It is highly recommended that you read all the sections
pertaining to your operating system before beginning
installation. This will save you time and trouble.
	This document describes how to extract the information off the
CD and install UName*It for both the regular production version and
the demo version of UName*It. For the demo version, you will mostly
have to follow the directions for installing the regular version of
UName*It. The differences will be noted. Demo users will get a limited
license key.
	UName*It is currently supported for five operating systems:
SunOS 4.X, SunOS 5.X, HP/UX 10.X, Linux 2.0 and Windows NT. The
UName*It server is supported on SunOS 5.X and HP/UX 10.X. It is not
supported on SunOS 4.X, Linux 2.0 or Windows NT.  The client portion
of UName*It (i.e., the user interface) is supported on all the
operating systems. The demo version of UName*It is currently supported
only on SunOS 5.X and HP/UX 10.X.
	To install UName*It on a specific operating system, please see 
the section in this document for that operating system.


Installing the Solaris 2.X (SunOS 5.X) Version of UName*It
------------------------------------------
The Solaris version of UName*It is supported for Solaris 2.4 and
later. The distribution consists of five pkgadd(1m) packages:

	ESMtcl			The ESM distribution of Tcl (needed by
				UName*It at runtime)
	ESMkrb5 		The ESM Kerberos 5 distribution (needed
				by UName*It at runtime and also contains
				the software for the Kerberos server)
	ESMuclnt		The UName*It client (UI programs, etc.)
	ESMusrv 		The UName*It server (only needed on single
				UName*It server machine)
	ESMdhcp			The Internet Software Consortium DHCP
				server.

	The ESMdhcp package is somewhat separate from the other
packages. That is, it is not contained in a cluster (discussed below)
and users need not install it if they are not using UName*It to manage
DHCP. Also, this package does not depend on any other package and no
other package depends on it being installed.
	Demo users should just install the ESMtcl, ESMkrb5, ESMuclnt
and ESMusrv packages on the same machine.
	Production users should install the ESMtcl, ESMkrb5, ESMuclnt
and ESMusrv packages on the UName*It server machine, the ESMtcl,
ESMkrb5 and ESMuclnt packages on UName*It client binary NFS servers
and only the ESMkrb5 package on the Kerberos server
machine. Production users need only install the ESMdhcp package if
they want to use UName*It to manage DHCP.  They should install this
package on the machine they want to run the DHCP server on.  The
default installation path for the ESMtcl, ESMkrb5, ESMuclnt and
ESMusrv packages is /opt/unameit.  The default installation path for
the ESMdhcp package is /opt/dhcp.  You can change this installation
path as described below if you wish.
	Solaris allows you to group multiple packages into "clusters".
When you install a cluster, you install all the packages in the
cluster at once. The four packages ESMtcl, ESMkrb5, ESMuclnt and
ESMusrv are contained in a cluster named "ESMunamit". Demo users or
production users on the UName*It server machine can just install the
cluster and the four packages above will get automatically installed.
	Demo users and production users installing the software on the
UName*It server should just install the cluster ESMunamit. Production
users installing a subset of the above packages (such as when
installing on a binary NFS server or the Kerberos server machine)
should simply use pkgadd(1m) to add each package individually.


Here is how to add the cluster under Solaris 2.4:

Run swmtool. When it comes up, click on the "Props..." button and
select "Source Media" as the Category. Set the Source Media to the
location of the CD and hit "Apply". This will automatically load the
cluster and show you an icon with "UName*It <version>" next to it. If
you wish to install the software in /opt/unameit, simply hit the
"Begin Installation" button. This will install the ESMtcl, ESMkrb5,
ESMuclnt and ESMusrv packages.  If you wish to install the cluster
somewhere else, right mouse click on the icon and select "Set Base
Directory...". Changing the base directory changes the installation
directory for all packages in the cluster.  Once you hit the "Begin
Installation" button, a cmdtool window will open up which allows you
to interact with pkgadd(1m).
    Note: Solaris 2.4 allows you to add a set of packages as a cluster
but does not allow you to remove a set of packages as a cluster. You
should remove packages in the following order: ESMusrv, ESMuclnt and
then ESMtcl or ESMkrb5.


Here is how to add the cluster under Solaris 2.5:

Run admintool. Select "Software" from the "Browse" menubutton. Select
"Add..." from the "Edit" menubutton. Set the Software Location to the
location of the CD. You will then get a form showing you a label named
"UName*It" with a checkbox next to it. Select the checkbox. If you
wish to install the UName*It software in /opt/unameit, then simply
select "Add" and the packages ESMtcl, ESMkrb5, ESMuclnt and ESMusrv
will be installed. If you wish to install the software somewhere else,
then you have to get around some admintool bugs.
	Admintool has a couple of annoying bugs. The first is that the
path set up for adding a cluster is ignored, so setting the
installation path for a cluster has no effect on the underlying
packages it installs.  Secondly, when you select the "Customize..."
button to change the installation directory of the packages, using
mouse button 1 doesn't apply your changes. You must use the Tab
key. To install the software in a different directory, you will have
hit the "Customize..." button, hit the right expansion arrow next to
the "UName*It Distribution" label and set each package installation
directory one at a time committing your changes with the Tab key. Make
sure you install all the packages in the same directory. Hit "Add"
when done.
	Like Solaris 2.4's swmtool, admintool doesn't know how to
remove clusters. Remove the packages in the following order: ESMusrv,
ESMuclnt and then ESMtcl and ESMkrb5.


Installing packages individually (not as a cluster):

To install packages using pkgadd(1m), change directory to
<cd_mount_dir>/SunOS.5.4. Then run "pkgadd -d. <package>..." as usual.


	When you install the ESMkrb5 package, you will be asked the
question

    Is this package being installed as part of UName*It?

Answer yes if you are installing this package because it is required
by UName*It (installing the cluster fits this requirement). Answer no
if you are installing this package on the Kerberos server machine and
you aren't installing any other packages.
	When you install the ESMuclnt and ESMusrv packages, you will be
asked

    Enter path UName*It will be used by?

Enter the automount path if it is different than the path where you
installed the software. For example, you may have installed the
software in /local/0/unameit but you may have it automounted as
/opt/unameit. In this case, you told pkgadd to install the software in
/local/0/unameit but you should answer /opt/unameit to the above
question.
	You should now skip to the section on configuring UName*It below.



Installing the SunOS 4.X or Linux 2.0 version of UName*It
--------------------------------------------
SunOS 4.X is a BSD based Unix and it has no installation program like
pkgadd(1m) under Solaris 2.X. Linux comes in a number of distributions
and there is no agreed upon package format (although RPM is quite
popular).  Therefore, the UName*It distribution is simply distributed
as a big directory hierarchy. Change directory to
<cd_mount_dir>/SunOS.4.1.3_U1/client or
<cd_mount_dir>/Linux.2.0.18/client and tar or cpio the files to the
location you want them. The server portion of UName*It is not
supported under these two operating systems. The DHCP server for these
systems is stored in <cd_mount_dir>/SunOS.4.1.3_U1/dhcp and
<cd_mount_dir>/Linux.2.0.18/dhcp.
	Next, to continue the UName*It installation, run the command

	<unameit_install_dir>/install/unameit_setup <unameit_install_dir>

where <unameit_install_dir> is the location where you have copied the
files.  The argument to the above script should be the automount path
if the automount path and the installation path are different. For
example, if you installed the software in /local/0/unameit but have
automounted it on /opt/unameit, use /opt/unameit as the argument to
the above script.
	You should now skip to the section on configuring UName*It below.



Installing the HP/UX 10.X version of UName*It
---------------------------------------------
The HP/UX version of UName*It is supported for HP/UX 10.X and later. The
distribution consists of five swinstall(1m) products:

	ESMTcl			The ESM distribution of Tcl (needed by
				UName*It at runtime)
	ESMKerberos5		The ESM Kerberos 5 distribution (needed
				by UName*It at runtime and also contains
				the software for the Kerberos server)
	UNameItClient		The UName*It client (UI programs, etc.)
	UNameItServer		The UName*It server (only needed on single
				UName*It server machine)
	ESMDHCP			The Internet Software Consortium DHCP 
				server.

	The ESMDHCP product is somewhat separate from the other
products. That is, it does not have any dependencies on it and it does
not depend on any other product. Also, users need not install it if
they are not using UName*It to manage DHCP.
	Demo users should install the products ESMTcl, ESMKerberos5,
UNameItClient and UNameItServer on the same machine. 
	Production users should install the products ESMTcl,
ESMKerberos5, UNameItClient and UNameItServer on the UName*It server
machine, the ESMTcl, ESMKerberos5 and UNameItClient products on
UName*It client binary NFS servers and only the ESMKerberos5 product
on the Kerberos server machine.  Production users need only install
the ESMDHCP product if they are using UName*It to manage DHCP.  The
default installation path for ESMTcl, UNameItClient and UNameItServer
products is /opt/unameit. The default installation path for
ESMKerberos5 is /opt/unameit/lib/krb5. The default installation path
for the ESMDHCP product is /opt/dhcp. You can change these
installation paths as described below if you wish.
	HP/UX groups software distributions into "products" and
"filesets".  Each product can contain a number of filesets. Each
fileset contains a number of files that you must install as a
group. You can install a whole product and all its filesets or you can
install an individual fileset within a product but you cannot install
individual files from a fileset.  All the five products above have two
filesets; one for the binaries and one for the manual pages. You can
skip installing the manual pages if you wish to save space, but the
binaries must be installed.
	For demo users and production users on the UName*It server
machine, you will need to install the first four products. To do this,
run swinstall.  Swinstall will ask for the source location when it
comes up. Set the source location to
"<cd_mount_dir>/HP-UX.B.10.20". This will show you the five products
in a window. Highlight UNameItServer and select "Mark For Install"
from the "Actions" window. This will automatically mark the products
UNameItClient and ESMKerberos5 and ESMTcl too since UNameItServer
depends on UNameItClient and UNameItClient depends on both ESMTcl and
ESMKerberos5. The ESMDHCP product is not marked since nothing depends
on it (and vice-versa).  If you simply want to install the software in
/opt/unameit, select "Install (analysis)" from the "Actions" menu and
everything will be installed.
	If you wish to install the software in another location,
things get more complicated. You will need to install the ESMTcl,
UNameItClient and UNameItServer products in your new location and you
will need to install the ESMKerberos5 product in the new location with
"lib/krb5" appended.  That is, if your new location is /foobar, then
the new installation locations should be

	ESMTcl		/foobar
	ESMKerberos5	/foobar/lib/krb5
	UNameItClient	/foobar
	UNameItServer	/foobar

You can change each products location by selecting it (one at a time)
and picking "Change Product Location..." from the "Action" menu.
	Production users installing the ESMKerberos5 product on the
Kerberos server machine can ignore the "lib/krb5" comment above. If
you are not installing ESMKerberos5 as part of UName*It, just set the
Product Location to the location you want to put the Kerberos 5
software.  Demo users can ignore this paragraph since they won't be
installing a Kerberos server.
	Note: If you install the UNameItClient and UNameItServer
products in a directory different from the automount path, you can run
into problems.  That is, if you install the software in
/local/0/unameit but you automount the software as /opt/unameit, you
will run into problems. When the software is installed, it creates
wrappers with the installation path in them.  Machines that NFS mount
those wrappers will see the wrong paths (i.e., they will see
/local/0/unameit in the wrappers and they won't have that
filesystem). The solution to this is to either install the software at
/opt/unameit or to install the software at /local/0/unameit and then
edit the wrapper afterward. (There is only one wrapper and a bunch of
files are hard linked to it). The wrapper file to edit is
<install_dir>/bin/unameit.  Edit the wrapper with vi since it has a
bunch of hard links to it. Emacs doesn't preserve the same inode
number and will break the wrapper.
	You need to install the ESMDHCP product on the machine
containing the DHCP server. This product doesn't have any special
conditions like the products discussed above, so just install it
anywhere you wish. See the notes on the ISC DHCP server below though.
	You should now skip to the section on configuring UName*It below.



Installing the Windows NT version of UName*It
---------------------------------------------
The Windows NT version of UName*It only exists as a UI client. The
UName*It server does not run under Windows NT. Also, upull doesn't run
under Windows NT. That is, we don't manage the Windows NT registry.
    To install on Windows NT, run SETUP.EXE in the WinNT
directory. You will be asked which directory to install the files.
Finish installing the files.
	After the files are installed, run SETUP.EXE in the newly
installed file's "bin" directory.  (That is, you need to run the
SETUP.EXE on the CD ROM first and then the SETUP.EXE that gets created
after the software is installed). The SETUP.EXE program has two modes:
Wizard and Advanced Setup. Choose Wizard. Next, verify the location
where you want to install the software and hit Next.
    Next verify where you want to put the configuration files used by
UName*It and hit Next. 
    The next form determines whether you want to add the UName*It
folder to the Start menu. This folder contains some various UName*It
commands that are useful but it does not contain the command to
actually start the UName*It GUI client that talks to the server. The
command to start the UName*It GUI client is mode specific and we will
add it later when we create a mode below. Pick a radio button and hit
Next.
    Next you must configure Kerberos 5. Create a new configuration and
fill in the fields

	Kerberos Realm		(Usually something like XYZ.COM)
	Default domain		(The default DNS domain for your long 
				 host names. Maps host names to the
				 Kerberos realm for the host. Usually
				 something like xyz.com)
	KDC Server Host
	KDC Server Port
	KDC Admin Host		(Host running kadmind)
	KDC Admin Port
	Administrator Principal (Principal in UName*It that can modify
				 the Kerberos master database)

The next form shows the configuration. At this point, all the files
are installed but not necessarily configured correctly. The next form
allows you to edit a UName*It configuration file for a mode you
select. Type in a new mode configuration name (it should be 8 letters
or less and lower case). Go to the Mode menu and select UNameIt Client
-> Create Site File and Host File. Fill in the fields

	Local FQDN		(Matches Kerberos instance in Kerberos
				 database).
	UNameIt Service
	UNameIt Server
	UNameIt Server FQDN	(Matches Kerberos instance in Kerberos
				 database).

Hit Okay. Now from the Start Menu menu, select Add to Start Menu to
add the UName*It GUI client that talks to the UName*It server to the
Start menu for the mode you selected.
    Lastly, you currently need to manually add the services for
unameitd(1m) and upulld(1m) to the
\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\services file.



Configuring UName*It If You Are A Demo User
-------------------------------------------
You will now need to get a license file from ESM by calling 
(714) 505-7686 x6 or sending mail to support@esm.com. You will need to
give ESM both the MAC address of your machine and the machine's
primary IP address. You will get back a file like

license_start		1/1/1997
license_end		9/15/1997
license_type		eval
license_host_units	64
license_user_units	64
license_key		4A21-3FFF-783B-8AD1-63F5-792B-B75E-6941

which you will need to put in /etc/unameit/license. You will also get
a UniSQL/X database key that looks like

AEFADQFCGDCBIQDBFIGGFSEHIVDABZAOEFAEALALABAPACAJAE

You will need to put this key in /etc/unameit/unisqlx_keys.
	Next run the script

    <unameit_install_dir>/install/unameit_setup_demo

This script will ask you a couple of questions. The questions it
will ask you and possible responses are

Where did you install UName*It? /local/unameit

Where would you like to put the database files (50 meg needed)? /var/unameit

It is recommended that the system you install it on have 64 megabytes
of main memory. You can install it on a 32 meg machine, but it will
thrash a lot.
	The UName*It daemon "unameitd" and UName*It pull daemon
"upulld" were started by the above script. To connect to the UName*It
daemon, set the UNAMEIT_MODE variable to "demo" with
	
	setenv UNAMEIT_MODE demo

or
	UNAMEIT_MODE=demo; export UNAMEIT_MODE

and run

	<install_dir>/bin/unameit

You are connected to the UName*It test database and can now make
changes. Next, run the backend by typing

	<install_dir>/sbin/ubackend

You'll need to run the backend each time you make updates if you want
to see your updates when you run "upull". To run a pull on a machine, type

	<install_dir>/bin/upull <hostname>

where <hostname> is one of the machines in the UName*It database. The
configuration files for <hostname> will be put in
/var/unameit/<hostname> (or whatever directory you gave to the second
question above).  Run upull on the same machine as you just ran the
setup script on.
	Manual pages are in <install_dir>/man. To shutdown "unameitd",
run "unameit_shutdown". You will have to send a kill signal to "upulld"
to kill it.



Configuring UName*It for Production Users
-----------------------------------------
Production users will now need to make sure the UniSQL/X database key
is in /etc/unameit/unisqlx_keys, the license key information is in
/etc/unameit/license and set and export the environment variable
UNAMEIT_MODE to the mode that you wish to run UName*It in. Then run
the "unameit_mode" command if installing the UName*It software on a
server or UName*It binary NFS server; otherwise, run the "upull_mode"
command if installing the UName*It software on a regular client
machine. See the documentation for more details.



Notes on the ISC DHCP Server
----------------------------
The ISC DHCP server will not run correctly until you have installed
the file /etc/dhcpd.conf. This file is generated automatically by
UName*It's backend. Also, if the file /etc/dhcpd.leases does not
exist, you will need to create it with "touch /etc/dhcpd.leases" or
dhcpd won't start. The dhcpd server will maintain this file
automatically after you create it.
	When pull runs on the DHCP server machine, UName*It
regenerates the dhcpd.conf file. Unfortunately, to get the dhcpd
daemon to reread this file, the DHCP server must be killed and
restarted. Therefore, upull will kill the DHCP server and restart it
when it runs. You should also set up your system to start the dhcp
server automatically at boot time. How to do this varies from system
to system, but most system use scripts in /etc/rc2.d or /sbin/rc2.d.
	Currently the ISC DHCP server doesn't work well on multi-homed
hosts. Try to put the DHCP server on a host with a single interface
if possible.



The UName*It Mailing List
-------------------------
There is a mailing list dedicated to UName*It. It is called
unameit-users@esm.com. To subscribe to this list, send a message to
lists@esm.com with the text "subscribe unameit-users [alt-address]" in
the body of the message. [alt-address] can be omitted if you just want
to use your regular mail address. If you want to use a different
address than the mail address you send the message from, fill it in.
	To unsubscribe from the list, send the message "unsubscribe
unameit-users [alt-address]" to lists@esm.com. Again, fill in
[alt-address] only if the address you wish to unsubscribe from is
different than the account you mail the message from.
	To post to the list, send mail to unameit-users@esm.com. The
Subject line is ignored in subscribe and unsubscribe messages. This
list is a Majordomo list. For help on using majordomo, send a mail
message with the body "help" to lists@esm.com.
